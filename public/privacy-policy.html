            not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We take measures to prevent the collection of
            Personal Data from children without parental consent.</p>

        <h3>8.1 Age Restrictions</h3>
        <p>Our Services are specifically designed for users aged 18 and older, and minors aged 13 to 17 are
            permitted to use the platform only with parental consent and supervision. We do not knowingly
            collect Personal Data from children under the age of 18. If we learn that we have inadvertently
            collected Personal Data from a child under this age, we will take immediate steps to delete such

            Personal Data, please contact us immediately. We will take appropriate measures to delete such
            information in accordance with applicable laws and ensure that no further data collection occurs
            without your consent.</p>

        <h2>9. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h2>
        <p>As part of our Services, your Personal Data may be transferred to—and maintained
            on—computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental
            jurisdiction. This section outlines the procedures we follow to ensure your data is adequately
            protected during these transfers.</p>

        <h3>9.1 Cross-Border Transfers</h3>
        <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to locations outside of your
            jurisdiction, including the United States, which may have different data protection laws than
            those in your home country. If you are located outside the U.S. and provide us with Personal
            Data, you understand that your data may be transferred to and processed in the U.S.</p>

        <h3>9.2 Data Transfer Mechanisms</h3>
        <p>When transferring your Personal Data internationally, we implement adequate safeguards to
            ensure the protection of your information. These safeguards may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Standard Contractual Clauses: We may use standard contractual clauses approved by
                regulatory authorities to ensure that your data is afforded a similar level of protection as
                required under your local laws.</li>
            <li>Binding Corporate Rules: In some cases, we may adopt binding corporate rules within
                our organization to facilitate international transfers while ensuring compliance with
                applicable data protection laws.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>9.3 User Rights</h3>
        <p>By using our Services, you consent to the transfer of your information to the United States or
            other countries, which may not have the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction. You
            acknowledge that our privacy practices may not be identical to those in your home country, and
            by providing your information, you agree to the processing of your Personal Data in accordance
            with this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>10. HOW WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
        <p>We may store Personal Data during the subscription period and up to 90 days after the
            cancellation of the subscription. Additionally, such information may be stored by third parties to
            whom we may have transferred it under this Privacy Policy. We take what we believe to be
            reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data we collect from loss, misuse, unauthorized use,
            access, inadvertent disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no network, server, database
            or Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error-free. Therefore, you should take
            special care in deciding what information you send to us electronically. Please keep this in mind
            when disclosing any Personal Data.</p>
